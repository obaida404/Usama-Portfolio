                                As the founder of Vertex, I set the vision and built a multi-sport academy and club spanning <strong>swimming, gymnastics, boxing, and basketball</strong>. I established our governance, operating model, and coaching standards, recruiting an experienced, internationally certified staff and embedding a <strong>safety-first culture</strong> across all programs.

                                Guided by the region’s quality-of-life agenda, I launched an <strong>accredited, multi-level curriculum</strong> that moves participants from foundational skills to competitive pathways. This includes water safety and water competency tracks, structured technical progressions, and athlete development plans, alongside <strong>female participation initiatives</strong> both on deck and in leadership.

      <p>
        At the International Water Sports Federation, I have had the privilege of shaping and leading programs that set the global benchmark for training, certification, and professional development in aquatic sports. My work focuses on raising international standards, ensuring safety, and empowering instructors and coaches with the knowledge and skills to create impact in their communities.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Over the years, I have developed curricula, assessment systems, and quality frameworks that allow us to expand across countries with a unified standard. Beyond designing strategy, I actively engage with clubs, schools, and ministries worldwide, collaborating to grow water safety awareness and expand access to aquatic education for all.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        One of my most important responsibilities is overseeing the certification of trainers and master trainers across a wide range of aquatic disciplines, ensuring that every professional we graduate is prepared to teach with excellence and safeguard lives. Among the certifications I issue are:
      </p>
      <ul className="mt-2 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Pool Lifeguard — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>CPR &amp; First Aid — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>Swimming Instructor — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>Swimming Coach — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>Baby Swimming — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>Aqua Fitness — Trainer &amp; Master Trainer</li>
        <li>Hydrotherapy</li>
        <li>Scuba Diving</li>
        <li>Special Needs Aquatics (Autism &amp; Occupational Therapy)</li>
        <li>Water Aerobics</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-2">
        Through this role, I continue to champion the idea that aquatics is more than sport — it is a life skill, a pathway to health, and a vehicle for inclusion. My mission within IWSF is to ensure that every certification, every program, and every professional we develop becomes a ripple of change, contributing to safer waters and stronger communities worldwide.
